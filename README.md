# Customer-Retention-Risk-CHURN-Analysis-Dashboard-ML-Prediction-Model
An end-to-end analytics project using SQL Server (SSMS) for ETL and data modeling, Power BI for interactive dashboards, and Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) to build a Random Forest model that predicts customer attrition and identifies key retention drivers.


Brief Step-by-Step Process

ETL & Data Modeling (SQL Server / SSMS)

Loaded raw customer data into a staging table, handled nulls, standardized fields, and created production tables and views for reporting.

Data Transformation (Power BI)

Built calculated columns and mapping tables , unpivoted service data, and created DAX measures for attrition metrics.

Machine Learning (Python)

Used Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, encoding, and feature preparation.

Trained and evaluated a Random Forest classifier using Scikit-learn to predict customer attrition and extract feature importance.

Prediction & Visualization

Applied the trained model to new customer data, exported predictions, and visualized predicted at-risk customers in Power BI.
