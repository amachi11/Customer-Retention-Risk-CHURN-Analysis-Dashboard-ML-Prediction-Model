# Customer-Retention-Risk-CHURN-Analysis-Dashboard-ML-Prediction-Model
An end-to-end analytics project using SQL Server (SSMS) for ETL and data modeling, Power BI for interactive dashboards, and Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) to build a Random Forest model that predicts customer attrition and identifies key retention drivers.

  STEP BY STEP PROCESS
ETL & Data Modeling (SQL Server / SSMS)

Used SQL Server to ingest raw CSV data into staging tables, perform data validation, handle missing values, standardize fields, and create clean production tables and views for analytics and reporting.

Data Transformation & Visualization (Power BI)

Used Power BI to transform data, create calculated columns and mapping tables, unpivot service attributes, and build DAX measures to visualize attrition metrics across demographics, geography, account details, and services.

Machine Learning (Python)

Used Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.

Used Scikit-learn to train, evaluate, and interpret a Random Forest classification model for predicting customer attrition and identifying influential features.

Prediction & Insights Delivery

Applied the trained model to new customer data, generated attrition predictions, exported results, and integrated predicted at-risk customers back into Power BI for actionable insights.
